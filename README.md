# Aquarium

In this simple game, the player's objective is to achieve the highest score possible. The time limit for each game is one minute. During this time, the player must purchase selected fish and prevent them from starving. Each fish has a different price and adds a different amount of XP per second. Points are deducted for each dead fish. The player also has the option to buy a larger capacity for the fish, so they don't need to be fed as often. Occasionally, the player can use a super ability to feed all the fish at once.
